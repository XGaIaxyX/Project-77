       <h1> Project on Console Screen 
        </h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a app where you can code multiple apps and even check them out by installing the live server extension. This app is even more advanced than Thunkable and Code.org because now you have to type, not use drag and drop blocks! </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Console Screen is where you can store data in your app! To open console screen, right click and then click on inspect. Once you're done with that, click on the top where it says console. To have data pop up in your console screen, you need to use the code "console.log();"</p>
        <script>
            console.log ("My First Console Project!");

            var first_name = "Krisha";
            var last_name = "Shah";

            var full_name = first_name.concat (last_name);
            console.log (full_name);

            var a = 20;
            var b = 4;

            var multiply = a * b
            console.log (multiply)
